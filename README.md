# It's time to grab TiTs!

The iris Token (TiT for short) is an ERC-20 token on Optimism, a Layer-2 solution for the Ethereum blockchain. TiTs are fully deceltralised and distributed to iris Verified Individuals (iVI) only.

## Genesis Offering

TiTs are initially distributed as allowances consisting of 1,000 TiTs each. 

The maximum number of allowances is set to 1 million. Therefore, the total max supply of TiTs is  1,000,000,000 TiTs. 

100% of the allowances are distributed to unique iris Verified Indiviuals to ensure ultimate and certified decentralisation, as each iVI is a unique human by design.

Allowances are distributed at no cost for the iVI besides gas fees. Although gas fees are low on Optimism, we provide - for iVIs in need - gas subsidies to ensure fair access to TiTs.

After the Genesis Offering is complete, admin/minter rights will be revoked to avoid minting or creation of any additional TiTs. The corresponding transaction hashes will be made available to the public.
